### Relationships
- **Courses to Teachers**: Man-to-One(Each teacher can teach multiple courses; each course is assigned to one teacher. A teacher can exist independently of a course).
- **Teachers to Skills**: Many-to-Many (Multiple teachers can share skills, and one teacher may have multiple skills).
- **Courses to Materials**: Many-to-Many (A course may include multiple materials, and the same material can be used in different courses).
- **Courses to Lessons**: One-to-Many (Each course can have multiple lessons, but each lesson belongs to one course. A lesson cannot exist without a course, as it has no meaning on its own).

### Schema Creation via FormCMS Schema Builder

#### Accessing Schema Builder
After launching the web application, locate the **Schema Builder** menu on the homepage to start defining your schema.

#### Adding Entities
[Example Configuration](https://fluent-cms-admin.azurewebsites.net/_content/FluentCMS/schema-ui/list.html?schema=entity)  
1. Navigate to the **Entities** section of the Schema Builder.
2. Create entities such as "Teacher" and "Course."
3. For the `Course` entity, add attributes such as `name`, `status`, `level`, and `description`.

### Defining Relationships
[Example Configuration](https://fluent-cms-admin.azurewebsites.net/_content/FluentCMS/schema-ui/edit.html?schema=entity&id=27)  

#### 1. **Course and Teacher (Many-to-One Relationship)**
To establish a many-to-one relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, you can include a `Lookup` attribute in the `Course` entity. This allows selecting a single `Teacher` record when adding or updating a `Course`.

| **Attribute**   | **Value**    |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Field**       | `teacher`    |
| **DataType**    | Lookup       |
| **DisplayType** | Lookup       |
| **Options**     | Teacher      |

**Description:** When a course is created or modified, a teacher record can be looked up and linked to the course.

#### 2 ** Course and Lesson(One-to-Many Relationship)**
To establish a one-to-many relationship between the `Course` and `Lesson` entities, use a `Collection` attribute in the `Course` entity. This enables associating multiple lessons with a single course.

| **Attribute**   | **Value**  |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Field**       | `lessons`  |
| **DataType**    | Collection |
| **DisplayType** | EditTable  |
| **Options**     | Lesson     |

**Description:** When managing a course , you can manage lessons of this course.

#### 3. **Course and Materials (Many-to-Many Relationship)**
To establish a many-to-many relationship between the `Course` and `Material` entities, use a `Junction` attribute in the `Course` entity. This enables associating multiple materials with a single course.

| **Attribute** | **Value**   |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Field**     | `materials` |
| **DataType**  | Junction    |
| **DisplayType** | Picklist    |
| **Options**   | Material    |

**Description:** When managing a course, you can select multiple material records from the `Material` table to associate with the course.
