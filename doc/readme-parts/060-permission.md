## Permissions Control
<details> <summary>FluentCMS authorizes access to each entity by using role-based permissions and custom policies that control user actions like create, read, update, and delete.</summary>

Fluent CMS' permission control module is decoupled from the Content Management module, allowing you to implement your own permission logic or forgo permission control entirely.
The built-in permission control in Fluent CMS offers four privilege types for each entity:
- **ReadWrite**: Full access to read and write.
- **RestrictedReadWrite**: Users can only modify records they have created.
- **Readonly**: View-only access.
- **RestrictedReadonly**: Users can only view records they have created.

Additionally, Fluent CMS supports custom roles, where a user's privileges are a combination of their individual entity privileges and the privileges assigned to their role.

To enable fluentCMS' build-in permission control feature, add the following line .
```
//add fluent cms' permission control service 
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlite(connectionString));
builder.AddCmsAuth<IdentityUser, IdentityRole, AppDbContext>();
```
And add the follow line after app was built
```
//user fluent permission control feature
app.UseCmsAuth<IdentityUser>();
InvalidParamExceptionFactory.CheckResult(await app.EnsureCmsUser("sadmin@cms.com", "Admin1!", [Roles.Sa]));
InvalidParamExceptionFactory.CheckResult(await app.EnsureCmsUser("admin@cms.com", "Admin1!", [Roles.Admin]));
```
Behind the scene, fluentCMS leverage the hook mechanism.
